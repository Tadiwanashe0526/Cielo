Meals are often communal, with a large plate of rice in the center and various side dishes to share.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Nasi Lemak:** Considered the national dish, Nasi Lemak is a fragrant rice dish cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaves. It's typically served with a spicy chili paste called sambal, fried anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts, a hard-boiled or fried egg, and cucumber slices. While often eaten for breakfast, it's popular throughout the day.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Nasi Goreng (Fried Rice):** A very popular dish, Nasi Goreng involves stir-frying rice with various ingredients like chicken, shrimp, vegetables, and a savory sauce, often topped with a fried egg.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Nasi Kerabu:** A unique dish from the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Nasi Kerabu features blue-colored rice (dyed naturally with butterfly pea flowers) served with various herbs, fried chicken or fish, salted egg, and keropok (fish crackers).\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Nasi Kandar:** Originating from Indian Muslim communities, Nasi Kandar is a plate of steamed rice accompanied by a choice of various curries and side dishes, often piled high.\n",

            "**Beyond Rice (but still important):**\n",

            "*   **Roti:** Various types of flatbreads, particularly Roti Canai (a flaky, pan-fried flatbread), are very popular, especially for breakfast or as a snack, often served with dhal or curry.\n",
            "*   **Proteins:** Chicken, fish, and seafood are widely consumed, prepared in countless ways (curried, grilled, fried, stir-fried). Beef and lamb are also eaten, though less frequently in everyday meals.\n",
            "*   **Vegetables:** A wide array of local vegetables are incorporated into stir-fries, curries, and salads.\n",
            "*   **Spices and Flavorings:** Malaysian cuisine is rich in spices, herbs, and flavorings like chili, lemongrass, galangal, turmeric, ginger, garlic, shallots, belacan (shrimp paste), and coconut milk, which give its dishes their distinctive taste.\n",
